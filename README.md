# SwiftSketch
### PnP Final

## Introduction
SwiftSketch is a standalone drawing tool tailored for small to mid-sized construction companies and contractors who need a fast, intuitive way to create on-site sketches and designs. It’s designed for professionals in landscaping and hardscaping who may not be advanced technology users but are comfortable with mobile devices and apps. SwiftSketch provides a simple interface to create architectural drawings associated with product layers, making it easy for sales teams to present dynamic pricing options on the spot.

Engineers on this project should focus on delivering a responsive, user-friendly experience that allows users to create and edit designs quickly with minimal steps. Core functionalities include essential drawing tools, shape templates, and the ability to layer products over designs while maintaining high performance and reliability. SwiftSketch will eventually integrate with the broader suite of construction-focused apps, pulling in data like product details and pricing for seamless updates during client presentations. The app operates independently now, providing a specialized tool for sketching and design needs.
